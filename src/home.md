# Audrow Nash Podcast Transcripts

> Full transcripts from the Audrow Nash Podcast.

Join me as I learn about robotics, AI, and manufacturing.

We'll talk with experts about their technology, business model, and personal experience.

I'm an engineer, and this is a technical podcast. But we assume no specific knowledge, so if you're interested, you should be able to follow along.

## Find an error?

Oops. These transcripts are made with [Descript](https://www.descript.com/) and then checked over quickly. I'm sure there's lots of errors unfortunately.

If you'd like to help, feel free to make a pull request with a fix. If you're not sure how, [here's a good page on getting started](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request).

Also, if you're into it, this repo has a `.devcontainer` setup, so you can easily make a [Codespace](https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces/overview) to preview your changes. (It takes a couple minutes to build the Docker image.)
